Ticket 1111
We'd like to add a page to view user profiles. Users can view only their own profiles but an admin can see anyone's profile.

A user can also update their profile, they are allowed to change their display name and phone number. Afterwards their updated profile should be shown.

For compliance reasons, we need to log when a user views their own profile. We don't want to log views by admins.

Just for clarity's sake, it would be nice if we could highlight on the page if the user is an admin.
